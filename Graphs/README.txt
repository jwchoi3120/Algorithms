Graphs

Explanation : I implemented a Directed Unweighted Graph. This graph is intended to work for a stream of edges getting passed in, meaning this will not be a fixed size graph and the allocation could grow on each insert of edge pairing.

Application Problem : With find_k_away function, I return all vertex ID's that are K (inclusive) vertices away, given a starting ID and value K.
