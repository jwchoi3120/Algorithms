Hash Table(focus on double hashing and fast look ups)

Explanation : I built a simple Hash Table ADT that should dynamically double in size when the load factor is greater than or equal to a threshold of 0.5.

Application Problem : Given a string S with no spaces or punctuation and a list of words (lexicon) I returned the frequency of the longest words in the string. It is guaranteed that S can be split into a set of distinct words.
