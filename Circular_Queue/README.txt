Circular Queue

Explanation : Implemented a Circular Queue, which is a data structure where items are added and removed using the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle, and the head and tail of the queue wrap around the array, creating a circular structure.

Application Problem: With CircularQueue class, I used it to complete the greatest_val(w, values) function. In greatest_value function, I found the greatest value in the list values at each possible array of size w.
